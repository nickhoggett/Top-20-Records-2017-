		<h2>My Top 20 Albums of 2017</h2>
		<div class="parallax"></div>
		<p>This was a particularly good year for music fans, here are my top 20 albums of 2017 this was an excerise I gave myself to learn parallex backgrounds in coding. Creating multiple back grounds for the album covers as static backgrounds creating the effect that the webpage is scrolling at two different speeds.</p>
		<div class="parallax20">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">20</span>. Kendrick Lamar - DAMN.</h3> 
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>This record has properly made it the top of most people list this year as it is a great hip hop record. Kenrick Lamar has made the most of his position as properly the biggest name in American hip hop at the moment. Often his lyrics are reflecting his recent success and where he's started.</p>
		<div class="parallax19">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">19</span>. Brian Eno - Reflection</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>I'm a big fan of the artist/music producer Brian Eno who released Reflection very early in the year which started out as an app which creates procedurally generated ambient music for which Eno is properly the pioneer of. There is several versions of the music available depending on which format you listen to this on.</p>
		<div class="parallax18">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">18</span>. Ghostpoet - Dark Days + Canopes</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>London based musician Ghostpoet put out an album this year which once again takes a new turn for his career. Delving in his psyche and thoughts of the UK's current political state on a personal level, though this record can often seem a little sufficating and little dense to unpack it suits the album subject incredibly well.</p>
		<div class="parallax17">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">17</span>. Kelala - Take Me Apart</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>After Kelala had realeased her 2015 EP <i>'Hallucinogen'</i> and several features on other peoples records there was alot of anticipation for her first full length outing <i>'Take Me Apart'</i>, and it hasn't disapointed either. This record shows Kelala has built a template for how to build a innovative pop career.</p>
		<div class="parallax16">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">16</span>. Father John Misty - Pure Comedy</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>This reocrd has helped me understand why Father John Misty has been haled as the recent title of indie rock's current hero a title the music industry is so often placing on him. As the title of the record suggests it's full of satire and very self aware ludicrous absurd lyrics all base on how rediculious modern society can be.</p>
		<div class="parallax15">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">15</span>. Queens Of The Stone Age - Villians</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Queens of the Stone Age's 8th Studio album Villains takes thier music in a new popier direction with the help of the very famous producer 'Mark Ronson'. This album is just great fun to listen to and take Queens of the Stone Age out of the familiar format they have been following for the past few records. </p>
		<div class="parallax14">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">14</span>. Four Tet - New Energies</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Kieran Hebden a.k.a Four Tet (DJ/Producer) returns with yet another great record this year showing a slight return to his output from the early 2000's by toning down the club bangers and including more samples from his often very collective music tastes.</p>
		<div class="parallax13">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">13</span>. Photay - Onism</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>New York's Photay music producer Evan Shorntien's first full length album following from the back of several great EP's did not dissapoint this year, this album is choked full of great samples, acoustics and even field recordings. I've returned to this record several times and it's better each time. </p>
		<div class="parallax12">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">12</span>. Jesca Hoop - Memories Are Now</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Jesca Hoop caught my attention when I learnt she used to be the nanny for Tom Wait's children while she caught stage and perfromance advice from him. Her work is often bewitching and playful which made her a great discovery this year. </p>
		<div class="parallax11">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">11</span>. LCD Soundsystem - American Dream</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Despite the negative reactions from music fans and the internet in general of LCD Soundsystem reforming after only 5 years after breaking I welcomed their return. Although the singles 'Call The Police' and title track <i>'American Dream'</i> were not that inspiring they sat on this more toned down effect.</p>
		<div class="parallax10">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">10</span>. Iglooghost - Neo Wax Bloom</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>This record caught my attention when I heard he was putting out a record on Flying Lotus' record label which makes perfect sense when hearing it. Don't let the cover of this album throw you it's not easy listening, it's hectic electronic music which often sounds like hundreds of Poke&#769;mon attacking at once.</p>
		<div class="parallax9">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">9.</span> Feist - Pleasure</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>I've always been interested in Feist's music but she's always fallen short of what I'd like to hear from her for one reason or anther. <i>'Pleasure'</i> is her 5th studio album an she has delivered a cracking record which I found throughally enjoyable.</p>
		<div class="parallax8">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">8.</span> Death From Above 1979 - Outrage! Is Now.</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Although Death From Above 1979's last release <i>The Physical World</i> when reformed in 2014 fell short following the heals of their debut <i>'Your a Woman I'm a Machine'</i>. <i>'Outrage! Is Now.'</i>shows they have gained plently of strengths the production has improved tenfold and new intrustments has brought much needed life to the duos music.</p>
		<div class="parallax7">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">7.</span> Luarel Halo - Dust</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Luarel Halo's 4th full length release plays even stronger to all her strengths, her disjointed electronic samples and beat joined often her toned down vocals.</p>
		<div class="parallax6">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">6.</span> Max Richter - Three Worlds: Music From Woolf Works</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Max Richter's score for the narrative dance piece Woolf Works shows how the minimalist composer has become obsessed with storytelling in the later years of his career. This modern classical record is inspired by the only known recording of Virginia Woolf's voice.</p>
		<div class="parallax5">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">5.</span> Dirty Projectors - Dirty Projectors</h3> 
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Dave Longstreth's breakup album following the split of his bandmate and longtime partner Amber Coffman, Longstreth reinvents the band Dirty Projectors once more as his solo endevour. Although thier classic sounds of hocketing female vocals have gone it still makes a great listen</p>
		<div class="parallax4">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">4.</span> Kelly Lee Owens - Kelly Lee Owens</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>Debut album from London based Kelly Lee Owens shows minimalist techno jams and dream-pop reveries. Mentored by the scene giants Daniel Avery and Ghost Culture, Owens crafts subtly stunning dance tracks anchored by her wispy, compelling vocals.</p>
		<div class="parallax3">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">3.</span> Arca - Acra</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>The first record producer Arca has made using his own singing voice which offers an often haunting and sometimes slightly uncomfortable listen. This is the record of his own that has made me pay more attention to him and his often scattered records.</p>
		<div class="parallax2">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">2.</span> Fever Ray - Plunge</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>After 7 years after releasing the deut self titled record and much aclaimed album Fever Ray dropped a new and more. Though this record does'nt offer much differance to her other now disbanded project The Knife, Karin Dreijer Andersson's 2nd Fever Ray is great fun.</p>
		<div class="parallax1">
			<div class="record">
				<h3><span class="position">1.</span> Lorde - Melodrama</h3>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>She has outgrown her youthful seriousness, dancing joyously like no one is looking, even though 10,000 are, though I wasn't taken on the opening single Green Light this album surprised me so much. It was delightful to hear a pop album which turns out to be a great adult and matured record.</p>
